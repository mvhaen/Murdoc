# Writing Murdoc Documents

To properly write anything using Murdoc, you only need to understand a few simple technologies:

 - Markdown
 - [A simple folder structure][folder-structure] to structure your document.

On top of that we've added some extra icing:

 - All features of Kramdown - a superset of Markdown - are also available. 
 - By exploiting [kramdown auto-id's][wiki-like-links] and [markdown reference-style links][wiki-like-links] you can use wiki-like links for references to sections of your document.
