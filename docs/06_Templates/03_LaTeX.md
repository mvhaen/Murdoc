# LaTeX

Murdoc uses LaTeX to export content to PDF. The individual files are converted to LaTeX using kramdown and are then stiched together by Murdoc. Using ***pdflatex*** we convert the tex file to a PDF.

The theme contains several tex files that are relevant:

 - **main.tex:** includes front.tex and back.tex. doc.tex will be generated by Murdoc.
 - **front.tex and back.tex:** modify for your theming needs.

 If you want to modify the theme, you will need some LaTeX knowledge.
